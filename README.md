Created in partenership with Sharon Fitzpatrick and Dennis Worley Jr for CSC 173: Data Visualization, we gathered data from The World Bank, cleaned and formatted the data, and added it into our notebook. Links to the data source are available in the notebook. 

I then created the visuals in JavaScript with VegaLite and D3 based on questions we had about the data. 

Our goal with this project was to stay high-level, and it may be argued that the visuals are not exceptionaly insightful. Our priority was learning the tools and Observable envirnment. For more insightful analysis from me, visit my Kaggle profile (https://www.kaggle.com/akashastallworth) and ask about my private data analysis and visualizations I have done for work using Tableau and Power BI.
